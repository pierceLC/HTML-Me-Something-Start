      <p> My first real involvement within the tech field started when I joined the military. My first job was as a cyber transport specialist in communications, where I worked on the hardware side of things. I learned how to set up network infrastructure from the ground up. I was stationed near Seattle, WA at this time where I got my first dog named Mickey. My son was a year old when we got him; took one look and said mickey 3 times and it was decided then. He was mickey and now apart of our family.</p>

      <p>After my time in communications I went on to a more paper oriented job in administration. I was in charge of most of the documentation that came through our unit, I made our awards and decorations, and helped our commander with any daily tasks that needed to be done. This job allowed me to be more involved with my fellow service members and helped me learn how to lead an office. Unfortunately during my time in the military I was in a training accident. It brought an end to my military career. </p>

      <testP class="funParagraph"> Now I am back in St.Louis trying to further my career in the tech field. I was told about Launchcode from a friend and decided to take the chance on coding and myself. Im hoping to not just learn javascript but multiple coding languages. With my knowledge and experience from the military I know that is a strong possibility for me as long as I continue to apply myself.  </p>
